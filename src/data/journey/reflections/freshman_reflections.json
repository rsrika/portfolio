        "reflection": "Goodbye high school, hello college! Graduating high school and embarking on my college journey at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unorthodox start to my first quarter at UW. While I was basically a Zoom expert at this point, I was definitely nervous to navigate the virtual college environment academically, socially, and personally. I wanted to perform well in school while also finding ways to meet new people in my year and major as an informatics direct admit. Despite all the new experiences thrown at me, I was able to not only push myself to learn new things in my classes, but also meet people this quarter that I know I will continue to be friends with throughout my time at UW. I was also encouraged to run as First Year Representative for WINFO (Women in Informatics). I have never run for a position like this before and I was excited to be chosen! It was so amazing to meet all of the other WINFO Officers, and the other FYRs, Melina and Sam. <br/> From my informatics cohort to my honors classmates, fellow WINFO officers and professors, I had the opportunity to meet some incredible human beings this quarter. Everyone has been extremely welcoming and supportive throughout my first quarter here and enabled an easier transition into my college life. Furthermore, I teamed up with some of these people for group projects, which taught me about the contributions and impact I can make as a team member as well as how I can best collaborate with others. My first quarter in Honors and at UW surprised me with regards to how different and engaging college classes can be. I came into this quarter expecting that the INFO classes I were taking would remain on the technical side, and the HONORS classes would remain on the humanities side. Rather, I found that my HONORS classes have exposed me to many technical topics, such as bioengineering, physics, astronomy, and storytelling. Although my INFO classes were technical on some level, they have also introduced me to social concepts like networking and presenting myself at career fairs. Having lived in Washington for most of my life, I had heard stories about the Seattle freeze, and was thus worried about making friends because I did not know anyone else taking INFO and pursuing HONORS. However, my experience was very different, and I was pleasantly amazed to find so many welcoming people at UW. I have been able to interact with so many awesome students, TAs, and professors that have made my first quarter and UW journey more worthwhile. Taking classes such as HONORS 100 exposed me to learning about several interesting opportunities that I would like to seek in the future. Later during my time at UW, I plan on exploring study abroad opportunities for my experiential learning projects because I am excited for the chance to see the world (when it is safe to, of course) and pursue my interests in climate change and society beyond a technical context. By the end of my first year in Honors, I want to have a better understanding of what experiential learning opportunities I would like to have while also making more new friends in the Honors program so that I can have my own small community within one large UW community. I’m proud to say I’ve already taken the steps towards this, as I was elected to be one of the first-year representatives of WINFO! I planned my first WINFO event as well, helping to put on Chatsgiving with the other representatives. By the time I graduate, I want to use all the skills I have learned to help me professionally and personally as I start my career, creating positive societal change through the work I do.",

        "Title": "WINTER QUARTER 2021",
        "reflection": "2021 started off with a (literal) bang and the start of winter quarter will be one that I remember for the rest of my life. Hearing about the insurrection on the US Capitol in the middle of one of my lectures completely took me aback. This was followed by many other events in the same vein, including the Biden inauguration and the explosion of racism against Asian Americans. Other UW students always told me that Winter quarter would be the most difficult, and that came true academically - I just didn’t expect it to happen so much on a political scale. Having paid attention to the politics of the last ten weeks, it feels like I have peeled back a curtain of how the nation and the world has been operating, looking at the globe with my now-slightly-faded rose-tinted glasses. On a brighter note, COVID-19 vaccine distribution has provided hope for helping the pandemic, but especially in times like these, I felt it was important to find the good in the midst of the chaos. Compared to the fall, I had a much lighter workload this quarter, taking 3 classes worth 15 credits instead of five classes worth 17. The courses were also less technical overall, with the only technical class being CSE 143, which I suppose was less difficult than people said considering it was online and I had been introduced to some of the concepts before. My TA for the class, Kimi, also recommended that I apply to become a TA for CSE 143! I did apply, and made it through the first round, but unfortunately, I did not move past the round where I had to submit a video of me teaching for loops. I personally believe that I am qualified for the role, and will probably apply for the job next quarter as well, or potentially apply to be a TA for another course. ​Outside of class, I have worked on my goals of building a network, and have been becoming more involved with WINFO as a first-year rep. I participated in the hackathon in January with Vidhi, Annika, and Anushka. This was the first hackathon I had ever participated in, and I even ended up working on the project until 3 in the morning, just to get a finished project. Even though we did not win an aways, I was part of the FYR team who designed the masks that were sent out in the swag pack, which look really cool. The FYR team also hosted an event called Pitch Perfect, where people could work with industry professionals and the iSchool career services to craft their elevator pitches, and it was a huge success. I also have been able to attend Diversity Committee meetings since joining towards the end of last quarter, and have been able to be a part of more events. This quarter, we had the Microaggressions Power Hour, as well as the “Keep Calm and Curry on” dead week event. I really enjoy being a part of the committee and I am glad I have gotten a chance to bond with and get to know everyone (Harkiran - the Director of Diversity Efforts, Rachel - the Director of Community Efforts, as well as Duaa and Gisele - the other committee members) better. Going to these meetings is something I look forward to a lot, and it’s a really fun experience to be a part of. I also ran for Director of Diversity Efforts later this quarter and got elected! I am looking forward to continuing to contribute to the diversity efforts for WINFO and the iSchool next year.",

        "Title": "SPRING QUARTER 2021",
        "reflection": "If I had to choose a defining word for this quarter, I would choose ‘complicated’. For me, Spring 2021 was the start of a lot of new things, but also filled with hardships created by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in India. Although things have somewhat stabilized now, the past five weeks have continued to create a massive shift in the way I think about the world, and how much I appreciate the people who have been a part of my life so far. For me, the hardest part of the quarter was balancing my school and personal life. At the start of the quarter, I was also fully onboarded as WINFO Director of Diversity. This meant that I started to actually plan the diversity committee meetings, as well as joined the iSchool IDEAS committee meetings. When I started taking responsibility for all of these meetings, I honestly felt like I knew nothing about what was going on, but I am very thankful to have had Harkiran help me navigate all the different aspects I now have to manage. My work as diversity director has been really rewarding thus far, and I am excited to be working with everyone to plan some really cool events! Even though I was taking 17 credits this quarter, I found myself pleasantly surprised that I was not swamped with assignments. However, One of the most challenging classes I took this quarter was INFO 340, which was focused on client-side development. Despite this being a technical class, I had never coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before, but learning these skills helped me to get an internship at Tech For Good as a Full Stack Developer this summer. My favorite class this quarter was INFO 498, or “The Future of the Record” with Professor Joe Janes. I think I enjoyed this class so much because the lectures were really engaging, and I learned about the different aspects of information documents and information systems, as well as what these might look like in the future. As the academic year nears its end, I am still getting used to the idea that I am no longer going to be a freshman in college anymore. This year has been one of the most unique ones I have had so far, and I am still hopeful for what the future will bring. Spring quarter has also allowed me to feel more like a “typical American” college student. Some of the best moments have been when I visited Seattle to meet up with Harkiran, Gisele, Duaa, and Melina, as well as when a few of them came up to Redmond to visit me. These moments helped me feel more connected to my friends, who I have only seen virtually until now. I’ve had some of the most eventful times of my life this quarter, and I know I’m not going to forget it. In future quarters, I hope to be able to meet and build relationships with more people, and positively contribute to the communities around me.",
