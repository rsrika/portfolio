        "reflection": "My first quarter in person! From going dorm shopping, eating Local Point (ugh) and on the Ave, attending in-person classes, and catching the bus on weekends, this quarter has been hectic but eventful. Annika and Vidhi are the perfect combination of roommates (even if our moms send us too much food) While it has been stressful, I have been able to build new relationships, make more friends, and get a more full experience of the ‘college life.’ I actually started my work for the school year way back over the summer, as Gisele, Pranav, Cynthia and I met over the summer to work on the FearLess, Tech More Innovation Challenge. We scheduled meetings to build a curriculum for the one-week virtual hackathon, which we ran in November of this year. As part of the preparation, I recorded videos on prototyping and wireframing, introducing these concepts to the participants. The hackathon itself went really well, as we had close to 11 teams participate, and selected 2 teams as winners. Both teams did an amazing job and everyone was very impressed by the quality of their work. I also had multiple students reach out to me to ask about informatics direct admissions after the event. As we got closer to starting the school year, I already knew this was going to be one of the best quarters of my life. I knew this quarter was going to be hybrid, and I knew I had to not only take care of myself but also continue to build on the friendships I made last year while also performing well in my classes. Outside of class, one of the highlights of each week was eating lunch with Melina, Gisele, and Emiri, as well as video calling Harkiran when I could. Creating interactions with my friends helped me take a break from my classes and catch up with the people close to me. With regard to my coursework, I took INFO 102 (Gender and Information Technology), INFO 270 (Data Reasoning in a Digital World), and CSE 373 (Data Structures and Algorithms). I chose these classes because I wanted to explore different aspects of information technology while also getting the hang of in-person learning. I also served as a TA for INFO 200 for the first time this quarter, under Joe Janes, and I had an amazing experience. My responsibilities were to attend lectures, grade projects, and teach lab sections. At first, I was intimidated by my students, as I was scared of making mistakes. However, after gaining experience by teaching classes and observing the other TAs, I was much more confident in my abilities as a TA by the end of the quarter. I think the biggest takeaway I had from this experience was to set boundaries with my students when they can come to me for last-minute extensions or advice, and to consider the situations they are in so I can best adjust to everyone’s needs, and I intend to work more on this next quarter. I thought this quarter was a great learning experience in terms of living (partially) by myself, and learning how to balance new situations as they come up. On a more personal note, this quarter has taught me, more than ever, about the importance of maintaining a balance both in school and in personal life. With everything going on, it can be hard to remember that you are not alone in whatever you do. Mental health is one of the most important things you can take care of, and the things that happened over this quarter and this break have made that abundantly clear. Rest in peace, Aravind 💜",

        "Title": "WINTER QUARTER 2022",
        "reflection": "This quarter has been a whirlwind of new experiences and accomplishments for me. As I started thinking about what I wanted to accomplish, I found myself seeking new experiences that would broaden my horizons and allow me to meet new people that I had not had the opportunity to interact with before. Key among this was my participation within the iMentorship program run by Professor Laura Schildkraut. I was paired with a mentor named Rosemary, who I learned that I had a lot in common with! I learned that Rosemary was the Director of Diversity efforts for IUGA during her time at the iSchool, and she had a wide variety of experience in the field working for different companies. I found value in this program by being able to learn from someone who has already established themselves in the field and I even invited Rosemary to attend the INFO 200 alumni panel, where all of the students truly loved hearing about her experience. By learning from Rosemary, I was introduced to a new professional route I could explore - UX Engineering - where I could work at the intersection of design and programming, combining my love for development with my passion for creating experiences people enjoy. With regards to my classes this quarter, I took HONORS 394A (Ways of Feeling) with Duaa, where I was able to build the vocabulary to talk about the way different cultures use words to express emotions, and how some emotions are present only within certain cultures. This interested me a lot because I was able to see how similar cultural backgrounds used words differently to express emotions. I also took STAT 221 and INFO 380, which have been incredibly valuable for me to learn the technical skills that I need to succeed as someone in the information field. Furthermore, I continued to be a TA for INFO 200, which has been a great opportunity for me to give back to the community and help guide new students in the program. I felt like I was able to offer more advice to my students this time around, sometimes editing essays for prospective informatics students. Outside of class, I continued to work with Cynthia to develop the iTech Modules project, which was part of an OMAD seed grant built to help expose middle and high school students to STEM topics through bite-sized modules. Working with the Diversity Committee and Cynthia has allowed me to build my own style of leadership and bring forward new ideas to expand STEM outreach. Of course, none of the things I was able to accomplish this year would have been possible without the support and guidance I received from the original WINFO Diversity Committee. In mid-January, I also had the opportunity to see the original Diversity committee in-person at Sweet Alchemy! It was a surprise for some people, and ended up being an amazing way to reconnect with the people who shaped my first year at the UW. WINFO has been such a large part of my experience at UW, so for me, the next step forward was to run as Co-President of WINFO, and at the end of the quarter, I was elected as one of the Co-President along with Melina! I have absolutely loved my time within the informatics program thus far, and I hope to continue to contribute to this amazing community as I begin to serve in this new position. ",

        "Title": "SPRING QUARTER 2022",
        "reflection": "Spring Quarter on the UW campus always feels exciting. Whether it is because of the thousands of people visiting the cherry blossoms, the newly admitted students visiting campus for the first time, or students finishing up their classes and enjoying the sun, the energy around campus just feels more exciting. I was able to get a firsthand taste of that energy as a panelist at Admitted Student Preview Day over spring break, where I answered questions posed by newly admitted students and talked about my experiences at the iSchool. I was also able to continue my work from past quarters by further developing the iTech Modules event, which was finally launched! We were able to host a mini lecture by Professor Joe Janes, and teach two modules on web development and cybersecurity. The event was a huge success, and it was incredibly fun to see the interest students had about informatics. I also had the amazing opportunity to present my journey through the iSchool in front of the UW Foundation Board. I met a number of inspiring people, including the CEO of AWS, and was also able to talk about how I came to join the iSchool and the impact I have tried to make within it. I’m really grateful to Cynthia for helping to write the speech and practice it every week. Melina and I worked a lot this quarter to determine how best to run WINFO. We decided that I would be the internal president, and she would be the external president. On my part, this meant that I attended SLC meetings, hackathon meetings, and facilitated the officer meetings as well. Additionally, Melina and I were invited to attend the annual Dean’s Club Dinner, where we met with a number of inspiring alumni of the iSchool! In addition to my involvement in WINFO, I also took CSE 414 (Databases and SQL), HONORS 212 C (Comic Books in the Middle East) and SOC 225 (Data and Society) which were all challenging and engaging courses, providing me with a wealth of knowledge and skills in a variety of fields. Although I was not a TA for INFO 200 this quarter, I put it on myself to take on new responsibilities while also having fun along the way :) One of the social events I attended this quarter was iCruise, held by IUGA (Informatics Undergraduate Association). It was a fun and eye-opening experience, where I got to socialize with a number of other informatics students, and take in the sunset views from the middle of Lake Washington! Overall, this quarter has been an incredibly valuable and rewarding experience, filled with learning, growth, and impact. I am excited to see where these experiences will lead me in the future and I am looking forward to continuing to push myself and strive for excellence in all my endeavors.",

        "Title": "SUMMER QUARTER 2021",
        "reflection": "If I had to choose a defining word for this quarter, I would choose ‘complicated’. For me, Spring 2021 was the start of a lot of new things, but also filled with hardships created by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in India. Although things have somewhat stabilized now, the past five weeks have continued to create a massive shift in the way I think about the world, and how much I appreciate the people who have been a part of my life so far. For me, the hardest part of the quarter was balancing my school and personal life. At the start of the quarter, I was also fully onboarded as WINFO Director of Diversity. This meant that I started to actually plan the diversity committee meetings, as well as joined the iSchool IDEAS committee meetings. When I started taking responsibility for all of these meetings, I honestly felt like I knew nothing about what was going on, but I am very thankful to have had Harkiran help me navigate all the different aspects I now have to manage. My work as diversity director has been really rewarding thus far, and I am excited to be working with everyone to plan some really cool events! Even though I was taking 17 credits this quarter, I found myself pleasantly surprised that I was not swamped with assignments. However, One of the most challenging classes I took this quarter was INFO 340, which was focused on client-side development. Despite this being a technical class, I had never coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before, but learning these skills helped me to get an internship at Tech For Good as a Full Stack Developer this summer. My favorite class this quarter was INFO 498, or “The Future of the Record” with Professor Joe Janes. I think I enjoyed this class so much because the lectures were really engaging, and I learned about the different aspects of information documents and information systems, as well as what these might look like in the future. As the academic year nears its end, I am still getting used to the idea that I am no longer going to be a freshman in college anymore. This year has been one of the most unique ones I have had so far, and I am still hopeful for what the future will bring. Spring quarter has also allowed me to feel more like a “typical American” college student. Some of the best moments have been when I visited Seattle to meet up with Harkiran, Gisele, Duaa, and Melina, as well as when a few of them came up to Redmond to visit me. These moments helped me feel more connected to my friends, who I have only seen virtually until now. I’ve had some of the most eventful times of my life this quarter, and I know I’m not going to forget it. In future quarters, I hope to be able to meet and build relationships with more people, and positively contribute to the communities around me.",
