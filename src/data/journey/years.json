I took virtual classes, attended convocation over zoom, and only went to campus a few times. Staying home made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the typical college atmosphere, but i found other ways to have fun - including going on walks with Vidhi, Tarini, and Mango, joining WINFO, and connecting with classmates over (really) bad movies. This year went by immensely quickly, and I know I have made friends that will last me a lifetime!"

Despite the hybrid nature of class, especially in winter quarter, I was able to make the most of my sophomore year and build upon the lessons and experiences from last year."

There were a number of rough patches, but I am glad to have gotten through them with the support of my friends, family, and larger community.

I have also finally learned to set boundaries and make time for the people who matter to me most. I want this year to be the year where I get to relax and truly enjoy my last quarters here. Stay tuned for more of my adventures!"
