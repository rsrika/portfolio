                    My name is Roshni (she/her) and Iâ€™m a fourth-year student at the University of Washington studying Informatics. I am a TA for INFO 200 (Intellectual Foundations of Informatics), and one of the two Co-Presidents of Women in Informatics (WINFO). I am also part of the Interdisciplinary Honors Program!
                    <br/><br/>
                    I was drawn to the Informatics program at UW because Iâ€™ve always been passionate about technology and its interaction with culture and wanted to integrate the two. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Iâ€™m a software developer, interested in all types of development. However, my passion lies in front-end and full-stack development, where I can build efficient applications that are usable and well designed to create amazing experiences for all people. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    I just finished a software development internship at Amazon, where I learned to use Rust. I designed a service structure to use in a production-level environment around the world. As I finish my college career, I plan on furthering my skills in React and server-side development, so I can be a better engineer.     
                    <br/><br/>
                    Outside of school, I love to play with my dog, eat food, watch Netflix, read new books, and take walks with my friends! (I also really love sharks ðŸ¦ˆ)
                    <br/><br/>
