It was freezing most of the time, but I learned a lot about wildlife management. Even though there are multiple signs posted about the danger of going into the caves, people still go into the caves anyway because they are naturally curious. One of my favorite parts of this trip was when we toured the ranger station and I got to be airlifted into a helicopter!"}, 
            {"gallery_img":"\\img\\journey\\Senior Year\\Fall\\Camping in Yakama.jpg", "gallery_alt": "A tent I built by myself", "gallery_reflection":"I took a field trip to the Yakama Valley to learn about the culture and history of the Yakama nation, as well as to experience the culture of the tribe. This was such a great experience for me, and I found so many similarities and differences between the cultures that I am part of, and the culture that was shared with me through this field trip. I left with a profound insight on how we are all tied to nature, and how cycles of life need to be protected so that all of us can thrive. One thing that I was especially proud of was pitching my own tent!"},

It was a short trip - we only went for three weeks, but the weather was a welcome change. We spent a lot of time exploring different places in Chennai with our cousin, and while the trip was hectic, it was still a lot of fun. This picture is from when Tarini and I were wearing saris and distributed kalkandu"},

I love the lehenga I am wearing because it is so light and it is such a beautiful design. Garba was also really fun, but I liked it better than last year. I think this will be one of the last South Asian RSO events I will go to - maily because I have more fun hanging out with my friends instead of the actual event. "},

One of the most significant aspects of being the Lead TA has been the opportunity to serve as a mentor for my peers. Starting in Fall, we had a lot of new TAs join our teaching team, and it was often my job to show them how labs worked, and what to do during lab. I am really glad to have Nila be a TA alongside me, and I felt like our friendship has grown so much. Here we are sitting in the sun in Gowen."},

I drove to Discovery park with Nitya and Sai (and 2 dogs) across the bridge. While I have been driving for a while, this was the first time I have driven across the bridge. To say it was an eventful day would be understating it. We drove through rain, then hail, a Montlake closure, and missed our exit 3 times on i5. But now that I've done it once, I am so much more confident in my driving."},
