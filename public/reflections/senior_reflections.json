        "reflection": "It's my last first day of school! Maybe ever? <br/> Coming into the school year was more than a little hectic because I only had a few days of break. After my internship ended, I was immediately working on events for iWelcome week, for WINFO's First Year Rep applications, and just getting into the swing of things. I don't know how to describe it, but the vibe just feels... different. I feel older but also more free. My biggest goal for the next two quarters is to go out more and have fun - I want to enjoy the little time I have left on Campus. <br/> In terms of class, I am actually not taking a single INFO class. Since I technically finished all of the degree requirements after I finished Capstone in the Spring, I am focusing this quarter more on my ESRM minor. To that end, I am taking four classes, three of which are ESRM related, and the fourth one is an Honors class about Data Science and WEB DuBois.<br/> Taking three esrm classes at the same time proved to be a really big challenge for me. Almost all of the material I was learning was brand new, and since I was taking upper divs, I often felt really behind when talking about concepts that were covered in the more general classes. Additionally, since I am not in the major, getting into the right class at the right time proved difficult. Despite all of the challenges I faced in these classes, I grew to enjoy them, and I learned a lot. One of my favorite experiences was going on a field trip to the Yakama Valley. One of the professors of the class, Polly, is a member of the tribe, and showed us around her tribe's home. <br/> Throughout this course, my perspective on ecology, natural resource management, social sciences, and culture has undergone a significant change. Coming into this class, I really felt out of my depth when doing my readings. However, learnign about Traditional Indigenous Knowledge and its intersections with western science and environmental management has broadened my understanding of how different ways of knowing contribute to holistic and sustainable approaches. With most problems, including climate change, there is no one ‚Äúright‚Äù way to face them. I learned that here, Empathy applies too. Taking the time to listen to and uplift marginalized voices can help us build stronger communities and tackle lager problems. ",

I left with a profound insight on how we are all tied to nature, and how cycles of life need to be protected so that all of us can thrive.

        "reflection": "Guys...... It's my last quarter!!! I seriously cannot believe I'm saying this, and will finally be done with my undergraduate degree. <br/> This quarter, I've taken a lot less credits - I'm taking INFO 441 to learn server-side development, ESS 100 as a fun class to learn about different types of dinosaurs, and Honors 496, where I made this website and fleshed it out in it's entirety. Since my only required class this quarter is for Honors, I chose the other two just for fun! I have really enjoyed taking 441 this quarter - I think it is one of the most useful classes I have ever taken at the UW, and I really like the way Kyle teaches the class. I am especially proud of my assignments, where I have worked on building a website sharer and also a productivity app. I think this class will help me a lot as I try to switch into front-end or full-stack development in the future. My dinosaurs class on the other hand, has been less useful in terms of my career but still so fun to take. I never knew that there were so many different types of dinosaurs (my favorites are Sinosauropteryx and Spinosaurus) and that modern-day birds are in the same clade as dinosaurs. I also have amassed a large collection of plastic dinosaurs that I got from asking questions in class. <br/> While this is my last quarter, there have been a lot of firsts. My goal is to be more outgoing, do a lot more exploring, and just have fun during the time I have left. I have spent most of my days this quarter hangin out with my friends and my roommates. Since Sai is finally back, I've loved having late night runs to I am Yogost, and cultivating my love for yogurt. (seriously I love yogurt). I've also been learning to set proper boundaries and protect my own peace. While there will always be some challenges to face, I've realized that the determining factor in whether that problem is solved is my attitude. If I build my life around the joy that I find, then I will be happy regardless of where I am. I'm writing this paragraph after doing a final presentation, writing a final exam, helping proctor an exam for INFO 200, and having music class. Tomorrow will be my last day of classes, and I have to say, reaching the end feels surreal. Looking back at my life over the past four years, I feel.. different (and also maybe taller? jk i'm still short) <br/> In reality, I feel older. It might be because I just turned 22, or because of all of the things I have faced over the past few years, or a combination of both of those things. Regardless, I can honestly say that I am not the same person I was 4 years ago. I don't know where the rest of my life will take me, but I can't wait to see it happen. ",
