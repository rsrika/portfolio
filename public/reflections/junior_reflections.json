        "reflection": "After attending Grace Hopper and setting up my apartment right before the school year started, getting back into classes again was both hectic and wholesome. It was hard to get out of the summer mentality of spending hours hanging out with my friends, taking long drives to the lakes, and spending every spare moment we could outside, but Iâ€™m glad I get to be back on campus with my roommates Annika and Aditi and see my school friends more often again. \nStarting this quarter meant I needed to get my head back in the game. I took INFO 300 (Research Methods), INFO 442 (Cooperative Software Development), HONORS 220 C (The Evolution of Human Behavior), and HCDE 321 (Portfolio Development Seminar). In addition to these four classes, I also was a TA for INFO 200 for the third time, and took on more of a role in WINFO as Co-President. The classes I took were academically challenging, but also fun. I learned more about the nature of people and their behavior, how to collect and analyze data, how to develop software while cross-collaborating with fellow developers and designers, and how to present myself professionally to employers. My workload this quarter was difficult to manage, but small activities like having lunch with my friends, having a picnic on the quad, and taking the time to relax and play with Mango over the weekends refreshed me and gave me the clarity and confidence to do well this quarter. \nOne of the biggest things I was a part of this year was the WINFO 11th Annual Hackathon! After some trouble with booking the HUB room, the best possible date to do it was December 3rd, which slightly threw us off because we normally do it in January. To get everything finished on time, I started to attend Hackathon Committee meetings with Emiri and Lucy so that we could plan everything out. Seeing the effort that everyone put into this event was awesome, and the past nine months of work was definitely worth it. I was so excited to stand in front of the room and host the opening ceremony with Melina and talk to participants, mentors, and sponsors. Watching the way that everyone worked together to build unique and inspiring projects that have the potential to make a difference reminded me that this is what WINFO and our team is all about. \nAlthough there were a lot of positives this quarter, there were times when the stress was too much to bear. Nobody is immune to overworking themselves and burning out. It was difficult to learn how to accept support from others and learn how to talk about things instead of bottling myself up and hiding it away. Being vulnerable is difficult - people may not understand you the first time. They might dismiss you, or just not understand your situation. However, vulnerability is a skill that can be learned. When one opens up to the right people in the right way, they can change your life for the better. I felt different as a person and as a student this quarter, as I took on more responsibilities, made more friends, and took on more of a leadership role within the iSchool. \nDespite the challenges Iâ€™ve been facing in almost every aspect of my life, I chose to view this quarter as a period of development and growthðŸ¥³Seeing the people I care about - my family, Harkiran, Gisele, Emiri, Melina, Joe, Sai, Nitya, and Vidhi made me feel incredibly supported. As we iSchool students always say, \"iSchool is my school!\"",

        "Title": "WINTER QUARTER 2023",
        "reflection": "Coming into the quarter, I attended more 'surprise' birthday parties then I ever have in my life ðŸ˜…. While it wasn't a bad thing, it can often be hard to find the balance between stressing out to plan the party, and taking the time to enjoy the party itself. The idea of balance has never felt more relavant than in this quarter. \nIn terms of classes, I took INFO 465, Time, Technology, and Design. Capstone, and an ENTRE class that was centered around the Grand Challenges of Engineering. I also was a TA for INFO 200, but this time with Professor Wes King instead of Joe. \n My workload was really different this quarter as well! Unlike typical tech-oriented INFO courses, this one delved into the realms of artistry and design. Our professor started the course by handing each of us a composition notebook and a box of art supplies. We worked on emphasizing experimentation over perfectionism, because we were encouraged to explore without a fear of making mistakes. In INFO 490, I finally started my Capstone project with Melina, Emiri, and Gisele. Sitting in 4 hour long classes on Friday afternoons was not my favorite way to spend my time, but I was excited about our project and I knew we would work well together! My third class, Grand Challenges of Engineering, was more like an INFO class tha anything else I had heard about in the business school. I worked on the Stanford design excercise, I worked on smaller in-class design excercises, and at the end of the quarter, I designed a resource to help improve access to birth control for students at the UW. I also worked frantically on my application for the Husky 100, as I was nominated by three people - Cynthia, Joe, and Anind. Initially, I thought I would use my honors portfolio as my application material, but then I realized that I am wayyyyyyyy over the page limit, so I decided to do an essay instead. While the portfolio didn't work out, I am glad that it gave me an opportunity to update this portfolio so that I wouldn't fall behind :))\nOutside of class, I had a much harder time finding ways to balance all of my responsibilities. One of my roommates was dealing with a lot of personal issues, and I essentially ended up becoming her only support system. While I initially was just really concerned about her and wanted to help out in any way I could, it became really difficult to manage everything all of the time. I tried to resolve this by usign official UW places for help, like SafeCampus, as well as other resources provided. \n At the same time, I was going through health challenges of my own. With chronic Bronchitis and a cough that was exacerbated by contracting covid over the summer. I spent a lot of time skipping class to go to doctor appointments, and I was finally diagnosed with asthma and a number of plant allergies that had only developed after I got COVID. While I wish they had found out what was causing these problems earlier, I am glad to finally have everything sorted out health-wise \n Navigating classes and personal things became really hard for me as the quarter went on. I started to fall behind on my work and very quickly felt overwhelmed and I felt like there was nothing I could do to get ahead. I am really thankful that I was able to reach out to my own support system, namely Sai, Harkiran, and Professor Janes, who all gave me different advice and also helped me take my mind off of things. I also spent time hanging out with my friends, like meeting Nila every Thursday in the Co-Lab to 'study' (we just talked and ate snacks most of the time), hanging out with Gargi for movie night, and checking out new places to eat on the Ave. \nHere's hoping next quarter gets better!",

Rather than a more tech-based INFO class, this was actually more artsy and design-based. On the first day of class, our professor handed us each a composition notebook and a bunch of art supplies. All we had to do was draw, so we were encouraged to explore different mediums and different materials while not worrying about mistakes. I think this is a really interesting way of approaching design because a lot of times people put an emphasis on perfectionism rather than the act of creation. Trying is always necessary before you get any better and one thing that I did notice was that at the end of the quarter, my drawings were actually a lot more cohesive and they felt a lot more put together even though I was using the same process as I was at the start of the quarter."},

Our final project was similar to that, but before we got there we actually had a smaller project where the professor gave each group $5 and we had to create the most impact with it. We could define impact in any way we wanted and we just had to create as much impact as possible. My group decided to turn those $5 into 500 pennies and we handed out the pennies to people around campus so that they could flip the coins into the fountain and make a wish. This is a picture of a senior walking group that we came across that was really excited to flip the coins into the fountain and they even let us take a picture of them."},

Once we got to Portland, we were able to check into our hotel and then we just walked around until we got hungry, ate some food and then explored the downtown area. The second day we went to Multnomah Falls and did a little bit of a hike. We took some more pictures and then came back for more food and more shopping.

        "Title": "SPRING QUARTER 2023",
        "reflection": "With the end of this quarter, I can finally say I'm done with my INFO degree! I took all of my required classes, and presented my capstone project, so all I have left to complete are a few honors requirements and classes for my minor. \nI started the quarter with a haircut from Gene Jaurez salon, and I have to say, I have never felt letter about cutting my hair - maybe ever! While it was a little pricy, I loved the way they made layers and really helped my curls pop. I thought of it as a little treat to congratulate myself on getting through last quarter. In reaching out to all of my support systems over last quarter and this quarter, even the ones from on campus, I realized that I was overextending myself. While it is usually a good thing to try to be empathetic and caring, the biggest thing that I learned over the course of this quarter was that I should not be prioritizing others over my own care because I simply cannot pour from an empty cup. Finding the balance between meeting my moral obligation to care for my friends, and the physical requirements to care for myself before I get burnt out was a hard lesson to learn, but necessary anyway. \nIn terms of classes, this quarter I took INFO 491 (Capstone part 2), INFO 498 (cultural Analytics), ESRM 426 (Wildland Hydrology) and Honors 222 (Natural History and Culture Museums). While 4 classes was a lot, I really enjoyed taking all of them. I felt like each of these classes excercised a different part of my brain, and the overlap was also something I learned from. \nComing into INFO 498, I had no idea what cultural analytics even was. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had in learning how to use PANDAS and collecting data from seemingly random places. \nWildland Hydrology was my first class after declaring the ESRM minor, and it was well outside my comfort zone. I learned so much about excel, and even relearned basic physics, which I have not taken since high school. I think i would not have dorrwn through thus class without the support of my peers in my study group - because this was the first time I had to take use a study group to verify whether I was actually using the equations correctly or not! Suffice to say I struggled a lot  - but it was surprisingly fun. \nHonors 222 was also a really interesting class. It met inside the Burke Museum, and we got to tour the different collections and exhibits and learn how they work. One of my favorite parts of class was touring the paleontology collection and being able to touch real dinosaur fossils! I also really liked looking through the cultural exhibits and learnign about the Native peoples who made their homes in this part of Washington. \nI think when the sun is out in Seattle, everyone automatically feels a lot happier. The days are getting longer, we have gorgeous cherry blossoms, and we don't have to lug around jackets or umbrellas anymore. To me, spring embodies a both energy and joy - something I think I really needed. Taking all of these classes + capstone while also spending more time focusing on myself, and starting music again has given me a greater appreciation for the role that balance plays in my life. Since I have finally started to take more time for the things that I enjoy, I feel more like myself and I am able to produce better quality work, and be a happier person. ",

        "reflection": "This summer I returned to Amazon (but with a different team) as an SDE intern! This time, I worked with the CloudFront Edge Compute Team, which was a massive change from my previous time working with the Adaptive Transportation Services. During this internship, I started off my having to learn an entirely new programming language - Rust, and it proved to be both demanding and immensely gratifying. I spend most of the first six weeks of my internship with a pen and a notepad, taking notes on the Rust principles and Syntaxm while also learning how EdgeCompute worked. I have to say that working at AWS was really fun, and a very different style of programming than I was used to. \nOne of the most rewarding aspects of my internship was the opportunity to tackle real-world problems and make tangible contributions to the team's projects. I knew that whatever project I worked on would create real impact for the team and the customers. My goal was to optimize the execution time of a service that my team worked on. To accomplish this, I spend hours designing and debugging a brand new data structure, which I then implemented within the existing codebase. \nThis was challenging for me because some of the files were written in different languages. While most of the files I modified were in Rust, I had to change a few files written in C, and use the C-API correctly to do so. I started out really worried to talk to my mentor and my other teammates, but I soon learned that they were there to help me succeed and they would answer all of the questions they could \nAt the end of my time there, I was proud of the code I wrote. By performing a load test on my code, I knew that it was capable of handling a staggering 8 billion requests per second. I also met my project goal, and contributed to a 150% decrease in the execution time of the service I was working on!\nOne of the reasons I enjoyed this internship so much was because, I was fortunate to make more friends and work alongside another intern. More than anything, I appreciated their companionship and being able to take breaks and grab coffee together made me feel more connected to my team. ",
